            <p>Medical imaging technology is instrumental in identifying the spatial arrangement of tissues or organs, aiding in medical diagnosis as well as research. Medical biophysics refers to the area of study in which physics is used to describe or affect biological systems for the purpose of treatment or diagnosis. In particular, medical imaging has developed from simple X-rays for detection and diagnosis of fractures to other techniques to accurately study various medical phenomena. Digital radiography, X-ray computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), ultrasound, optical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are different methods employed to study internal systems non-invasively. Imaging can help understand and visualize tissue composition, morphology and function, and quantitative descriptions of many fundamental biological processes. Various techniques are employed for imaging which can be either fluorescence-based, spectroscopy-based, light scattering or multi-photon techniques. </p>

            <p>Radiography</p>
            
            <p>X-rays are electromagnetic rays with wavelengths ranging from 0.01 nm up to 10 nm. These rays lose a certain amount of energy when passing through different materials, depending on the absorption behavior of the material. This is the principle behind traditional X-ray imaging/radiography. The difference in energy loss allows us to discern tissues and bones from one another. It should be noted that high energies emitted to the body during an X-ray acquisition may damage the DNA and lead to an increased risk of cancer. The X-rays are generated using a vacuum X-ray tube having a cathode and a solid metal anode. The main application of radiography is examination of fractures and studying the skeletal system or detection of osteoporosis or bone cancer. Another application of X-rays is in digital subtraction angiography using a contrast agent to study arteries and veins. </p>
            
            <p>Computed Tomography (CT)</p>
            
            <p>The term CT refers to a computerized x-ray imaging procedure involving a narrow beam of x-rays aimed at a patient and rotated around the body to generate cross-sectional images to form a 3D image for identification of tumors and anomalies. The thickness of tissue represented in each slice can range from 1-10 millimeters. X-ray detectors are located directly opposite the x-ray source and they transmit the rays to a computer. CT scans can be used to detect blood clots, excess fluid, pneumonia, tumors etc. The advantage of this technique is that it reveals more detail than a traditional X-ray procedure and the 3D <p>image can be rotated to study the exact place where the problem is located. Contrast agents can be used to obtain clearer images. </p>
             
            <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</p>
            
            <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a non-invasive imaging technique used to produce 3D detailed anatomical images used for detection, diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Powerful magnets producing a strong magnetic field are used in MRIs forcing the protons in the body to align with the field. Then, a radiofrequency current is pulsed through the patient, simulating the protons which spin out of equilibrium straining against the pull of the field. When the current is turned off, sensors are able to detect the energy released when protons realign with the magnetic field. Properties like the time taken for realigning and the energy released are used to differentiate between various types of tissues. MRIs are different from CT scans because there is no use of ionizing radiation. MRIs are used to study the brain (it can differentiate between white matter and gray matter), spinal cord, nerves, muscles, ligaments and tendons. Although radiation is not used in MRIs, a very strong magnetic field is employed. It should be ensured that patients undergoing MRI scans do not have metallic implants like pacemakers or cochlear implants.</p>
            
            <p>Nowadays, imaging science extends beyond the traditional discipline of clinical radiology. Even pharmaceutical companies use imaging while developing new drugs to obtain information on responses non-invasively. </p>
