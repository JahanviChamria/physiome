            <p>Taste receptor cells are neuroepithelial cells generally clustered into multicellular arrays known as taste buds. A taste bud is composed of two parts: the apical region and the basal region. The apical region faces the oral cavity and is the site of interaction between stimuli and taste receptor cells. The two regions are separated by tight junctions limiting the diffusion of several compounds from the mucosal space to the serosal space. It acts as a selective filter for many ions, affecting the magnitude of some tastes like salty taste transduction.</p>

<p>There exist five basic taste sensations: salty, bitter, sweet, sour and umami. The first four are commonly understood while umami may be less known. It corresponds to the taste of amino-acids, a meaty and savory sensory cue. These different flavors are perceived owing to the food molecules’ varied interaction with taste receptors. Sweet, umami and bitter receptors are G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) while salt and sour receptors are ion channels for Na+ and H+ respectively. Some stimuli generate second messengers after interacting with receptors whereas in other cases, the taste stimulus itself is transported into the cytoplasm of the taste bud cells and activates downstream events. There are three main cell types in taste buds: type I, type II and type III cells. </p>

<p>Sweet: Sugars/carbohydrates are detected by the heterodimer composed of two GPCRs – T1R2 and T1R3. When cultured cells are co-transfected with these GPCRs, they respond to sucrose, fructose, artificial sweeteners and some d-amino acids that elicit a sweet taste. Starch is considered to be tasteless to humans. </p>

<p>Umami: Amino acids like glutamate and aspartate taste umami. The stimulus for umami taste is monosodium glutamate (MSG) which is abundantly present in meat, fish, cheese and vegetables. It has been widely documented that T1R1-T1R3 heterodimers, variants of mGluR4 and mGluR1 receptors play a role in detecting umami taste. </p>

<p>Bitter: Bitter taste is stimulated by a large number of compounds. Its receptors (T2Rs) are class A GPCRs having short N termini and ligand-binding sites in their transmembrane segments. T2Rs function as monomers unlike T1Rs. </p>

<p>Sour: The stimulus for sour taste is intracellular acidification. Organic acids like citric acid are more potent stimuli compared to mineral acids like HCl. This is due to greater membrane permeability of undissociated organic acid molecules causing the generation of protons in the cytoplasm. Type III cells depolarize and produce Ca2+ responses to acids. </p>

<p>Salty: It remains unclear exactly which receptors are involved in the transduction of NaCl. Animals and humans readily consume NaCl below isotonic concentrations to ensure the adequate ingestion of an essential mineral. However, higher concentrations of it are aversive presumably to protect individuals against hypernatraemia and dehydration. </p>

<p>There are several models explaining how information from taste buds is transmitted to the CNS. The labeled-line coding model states that taste bud cells identify a particular taste quality and synapse with afferent fibers dedicated to that taste quality. Another model states that information is transmitted by combinatorial activity in multiple peripheral afferent fibers and the combination of encoded fibers encodes the taste quality, similar to color vision and odor recognition. Differences in taste perception may be attributed to genetic variations or genetic polymorphisms located in genes involved in taste perception. </p>
