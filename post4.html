            <p>The auditory receptor organ or the cochlea is the most complex mechanical apparatus in the human body, having over a million essential moving parts. We hear sound when sound waves are transferred into pressure waves in our middle ear and pass through the fluid in our inner ear, where they are converted into signals that our brains interpret. However, the complexity of this organ has caused difficulty in understanding how it produces electrical signals in response to auditory stimulation. The human ear has a range of 0dB to 120-130 dB and it can detect frequencies between 20 Hz and 20000 Hz. </p>

<p>When sound waves enter the auditory canal, the eardrum is set into vibration. The Eustachian tube equalizes pressure on either side of the eardrum to prevent it from being ruptured. Three small bones, collectively known as ossicles incorporate a lever mechanism in order to amplify the vibrations of the tympanic membrane or the eardrum. It has an area of 0.55 cm2 whereas the oval window following the ossicles has an area of only 0.32 cm2. The fulcrum of this lever system lies between malleus and incus on one side and stapes on the other. A torque acts on incus which transmits a pressure on the oval window in turn, amplifying the sound 17.2 times in the middle ear which helps overcome the acoustic resistance of the cochlear fluid. </p>

<p>The cochlea or the inner ear is divided by the basilar membrane into two chambers. The membrane is wide and thin at the apex but thick and narrow at the base, causing sound waves in the cochlear fluid to produce a peak amplitude of the membrane at a certain point. Thousands of auditory receptor cells or hair cells are embedded in the basilar membrane. Movement of the cochlear fluid stimulates the hair cells which then pass signals to the auditory cortex of the brain. The hair cells are epithelial cells lacking axons and dendrites but capable of making synapses onto afferent nerve fibers of the 8th cranial nerve and receiving synapses from axons originating in the brain. </p>

<p>On the surface of hair cells, mechanosensitive ion channels are present and gated by mechanical forces. By bending the hair bundle, the hair-like projections on the hair cell, the cell membrane undergoes either compression or stretching that subsequently leads to the opening or closing of these ion channels. The hair cell membrane develops an electrical potential difference caused by potassium and calcium ions flowing in through the ion channels. Hair cells generate an electrical current through the movement of ions, and can produce an action potential when sufficiently depolarized. </p>

<p>Neurotransmitters (or chemical signals) are released at the synapses between sensory neurons and hair cells when an action potential is generated by the latter. These neurotransmitters indicate sound presence to the sensory neurons. The ear sends electrical impulses through the auditory nerve to be relayed by sensory neurons to the brain. Brain interpretation occurs through the auditory nerve, which connects to several regions of the brain such as the auditory cortex. This cortex processes and perceives sounds by converting electrical signals, enabling us to comprehend whatever we hear.</p>
